 🔮 Building a predictive system to predict the house price

- 📊 Data preprocessing is important to make the data suitable for feeding into the machine learning model, and it may include steps like handling missing values and scaling the data.the Boston House Price dataset, which contains 14 features and the price of houses as the label. It explains how to preprocess the data and analyze the correlation between features using a heatmap.

- 🔀 The train-test split is necessary to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data and avoid overfitting.
The data is split into training and testing data using the train_test_split function. The XGBoost regressor model is then trained on the training data and evaluated using metrics such as R-squared error and mean absolute error.
- 📈 Xt Boost regression is a decision tree-based ensemble model that is effective for regression problems like house price prediction.
- 🧪 Evaluation metrics like R-squared error and mean absolute error help assess the accuracy and performance of the model.
- 📉 The scatter plot visualization shows the proximity between the predicted and actual house prices, indicating the model's accuracy and reliability.
- 🏆 This project demonstrates the successful implementation of a house price prediction system using machine learning, showcasing the potential for real-world applications.
